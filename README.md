# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project: 
### *Explain the purpose of this analysis.*
#### The purpose of this Module and Project is to learn how to code in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Macros in Excel using Microsoft Office applications, and thus learning some of the building blocks of programming. 
####
#### VBA code was written to create VBA Macros to help Steve with the analysis of a set of green energy stocks contained within the Excel dataset (green_stocks.xlsx) he has given me. VBA was used to automate the tasks he requested to be used with any stock and with multiple years returning the Stock Ticker Name, Stock Daily Volume, and Average Daily Return. 

##
## Results: 
### *Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.*
#### The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
####
##
## Summary: 
### In a summary statement, address the following questions.
####
### *What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?*
#### The advantage of refactoring code is keeps you from having to reinvent the wheel when writing code for projects that have similar specs, requirements, or outcomes. Refactoring allows you to cut and paste previously written code and adapt it to the project at hand decreasing coding time. A disadvantage is if you are not careful in refactoring your code it could create a unusable product that will not run or return the results or data you are looking for.
####
### *How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?*
#### I was able to save a lot of time copying over the AllStocksAnalysisRefactored subroutine file to the Macro and since I didnâ€™t have to code all the formatting, inputs, and reporting. What gave me problems was trying to figure out how to loop with only one variable when Module 2 gave an example with two. After I was able to code out the whole entire Macro it kept crashing until I figured out, I had an error in the code that increases the tickerIndex by using Cells(i-1,1) instead of Cells(i+1,1).
